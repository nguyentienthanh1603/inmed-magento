# NOTE: Consider two facts before modifying "assign-postgres-password":
# (1) Passing the "ALTER ROLE ..." through the psql command only works
#     if passwordless authorization was configured for local connections.
#     For example, if pg_hba.conf has a "local all postgres ident" rule.
# (2) It is probably fruitless to optimize this with a not_if to avoid
#     setting the same password. This chef recipe doesn't have access to
#     the plain text password, and testing the encrypted (md5 digest)
#     version is not straight-forward.
